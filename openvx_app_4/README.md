# openvx_app_2

Second exercise is to take the code from first exercise and create YUV image
with format `VX_DF_IMAGE_UYVY` instead of RGB and save to file. Also modify the
python script to convert UYVY image to png (Hint: OpenCV conversion code `COLOR_YUV2BGR_UYVY`).

## Output

Here's how the image should look.
