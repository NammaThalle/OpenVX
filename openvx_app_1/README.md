# openvx_app_1

First exercise is to just understand this code, build and run it. The app
creates an RGB `vx_image` using `vxCreateImage`, gets direct access to raw
buffer, fills pixel values and saves the raw image as `image.rgb`.

Use `rgb2png.py` to convert the saved `.rgb` fie to `.png`.

## Output

Here's how the image should look.
